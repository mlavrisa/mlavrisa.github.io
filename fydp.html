        <h2>Fourth Year Engineering Design Project</h2>
        <p>
          For my fourth year design capstone project at the University of
          Waterloo, my team and I developed a pioneering colour-changing
          reflective technology. Our project won first place in our year, and
          focused on designing an array of plasmonic tiles immersed in a layer
          of liquid crystal that alter their colour with applied voltage because
          of the changing orientation of the liquid crystal under that voltage.
          We began by simulating the optical response under different refractive
          index conditions (n = 1.5/1.7) using the RSoft photonic simulation
          package, which allowed us to select the tile geometries predicted to
          yield the most pronounced colour shifts. The selected designs were
          then fabricated in Waterloo's state&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;art
          cleanroom in the QNC, and then tested&mdash;the switching speed
          achieved was 302 milliseconds, and the voltage&ndash;colour
          characteristics exhibited low hysteresis despite some non&ndash;linear
          behavior.

          <strong>Exploded View:</strong> This image presents a cross-sectional,
          exploded view of the device. From top to bottom, it shows an ITO glass
          substrate, followed by a layer of liquid crystal with an interposed
          gasket, and finally plasmonic nanotiles deposited on an
          aluminum-coated silicon substrate. This detailed illustration helps in
          understanding the multilayer structure of the technology.

          <strong>Fabrication Process:</strong> The fabrication process is
          depicted here. The image outlines the sequential steps: exposing the
          photoresist over an aluminum layer using ebeam, developing the
          pattern, depositing a titanium adhesion layer, adding a gold layer,
          and finishing with a liftoff. These steps were crucial in forming the
          precise features of the plasmonic tiles.

          <strong>SEM Imaging:</strong> An SEM image captures the circular
          features produced during fabrication. This micrograph confirms the
          quality and uniformity of the lithographic patterning that forms the
          plasmonic tiles.

          <strong>Simulation Results:</strong> This visualization shows the
          outcome of scanning the plasmonic tile width (vertical axis) versus
          the tile pitch (horizontal axis). The simulation estimates the
          resulting colour at the ordinary and extraordinary axes of the liquid
          crystal, guiding the selection of the most effective tile geometries.

        <p>
          <strong>Optimized Grid:</strong> Based on the simulation data, the
          pitches and widths that offered the most dramatic colour change were
          selected and fabricated into a 3x4 grid of patches. This grid
          represents the culmination of our design and optimization efforts.

        <p>
          <strong>Dynamic Colour Change:</strong> In this video, captured via
          microscope, one of the patches is shown undergoing a voltage scan. The
          device transitions from a greenish hue at low voltage to a light brown
          tone, effectively demonstrating its responsive optical behaviour.

      <h2>About Tidal Productivity App</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Tidal &mdash; an all-in-one productivity platform that serves as
        your personal accountability buddy, to-do manager, habit tracker, and
        journaling companion. Tidal harnesses the power of an encouraging
        language model that greets you each morning, checks in on your progress,
        and offers helpful advice and thoughtful reframing when setbacks occur.
        By integrating your habits list, daily tasks, and personal bio, Tidal
        tailors its guidance to what matters most to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every morning, Tidal greets you and prompts a reflective discussion
        about your previous day&apos;s progress and today&apos;s plans. It even
        transforms your daily chat into a journal entry and compiles weekly and
        monthly summaries for you to review and edit. This comprehensive
        approach encourages a solid morning routine and continuous personal
        growth, helping you achieve your goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is made using the eel framework, combining python, and
        vanilla javascript and css. I make streaming calls to an LLM endpoint
        for the chat agent, and store all of the tasks, habits, messages and
        journal entries in a sqlite database.
      </p>
      <div class="imgdiv">
        <img src="img/assistant.png" alt="Tidal main interface" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The main interface, illustrated above, is split into two key sections.
        On the left, you have an interactive LLM chat window where Tidal listens
        and responds with encouragement. On the right, a task list helps you
        plan your day. This task list is designed with several interactive
        features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A checkbox to mark tasks as complete.</li>
        <li>
          A toggle to indicate whether you plan to work on that task today.
        </li>
        <li>A snooze button to defer tasks when needed.</li>
        <li>
          An Eisenhower matrix quadrant indicator to help prioritize tasks by
          urgency and importance.
        </li>
        <li>A description of the task</li>
        <li>
          A "micro action" fieldâ€”the smallest actionable step to get started.
        </li>
        <li>A due date display to keep your schedule organized.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="imgdiv">
        <img src="img/assistant-habits.png" alt="Tidal habits list interface" />
      </div>
      <p>
        In addition to managing your tasks, Tidal includes a robust habits
        tracker to help you build and maintain positive routines. The habits
        list, shown in the above image, has the following functionality:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A radio button that lets you select the primary habit you want to
          focus on.
        </li>
        <li>
          An indicator showing which habits you&apos;ve already established.
        </li>
        <li>Descriptions for each habit</li>
        <li>A field specifying when you plan to perform them.</li>
        <li>The minimal action required to count as progress.</li>
        <li>
          An explanation of why each habit is important, connecting your daily
          actions to your broader goals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Despite being a relatively simple desktop-only app, I have found it to
        be an incredibly helpful tool for my own productivity and
        self-improvement path. I use it every day and find it to be a great way
        to stay focused and motivated. I plan to beta test it with some friends
        and produce a web version and mobile app in the future.
